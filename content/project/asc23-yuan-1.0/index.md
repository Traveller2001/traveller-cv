ShortX is an extensible toolkit that provides various AI model optimization techniques:

- ShortGPT: Identifies and removes redundant layers in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce model size and inference time while maintaining performance
- ShortV: Optimizes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by selectively freezing visual token processing in ineffective layers
