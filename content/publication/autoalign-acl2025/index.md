abstract: 'Automated Alignment refers to a set of algorithms designed to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intentions and values while minimizing manual intervention. However, it faces challenges such as algorithmic diversity and excessively convoluted workflows. We present AutoAlign, an open-source toolkit that offers: (1) a unified framework integrating mainstream automated algorithms through a consistent interface, and (2) an accessible workflow supporting one-click execution for prompt synthesis, automatic alignment signal construction, and iterative model training. Our toolkit enables easy reproduction of existing results through extensive benchmarks and facilitates the development of novel approaches via modular components. It includes implementations for both highly efficient inference and training, as well as low-resource training. By standardizing automated alignment methodologies and providing accessible implementations, AutoAlign lowers the barriers to building customized aligned models and supports academic research.'

summary: An open-source toolkit for automated alignment of Large Language Models with human intentions and values.
