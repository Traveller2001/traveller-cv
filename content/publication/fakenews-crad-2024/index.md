abstract: The advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology has significantly contributed to progress in various fields. However, this technological development has also inadvertently facilitated the creation and widespread dissemination of misinformation. The paper proposes a fine-grained fake news detection method with implicit semantic enhancement, utilizing the summarization and reasoning capabilities of existing generative large language models.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
